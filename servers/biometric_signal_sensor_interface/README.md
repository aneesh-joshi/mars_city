# Biometric Signal Sensor's Interface
=========================

When astronauts travels to Mars, or even other planets, they will be exposed to a number of hazards e.g. radiation, microbes in the spacecraft, planetary surface toxic dust. This project mainly revolves around configuring biometric signal sensors. 
The project is part of the current studies on the simulation of an Astronautâ€™s Health Monitor system.
